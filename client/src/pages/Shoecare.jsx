                    <p>
                        Use a soft brush or cloth to remove dirt and debris from your shoes after every wear. For leather shoes, use a damp cloth and mild soap, and avoid soaking the material.

                    <h3>2. Protect with Conditioner</h3>
                    <p>
                        For leather and suede shoes, apply a conditioner or protective spray to maintain flexibility and prevent cracking. Make sure to use products specific to your shoe material.

                    <p>
                        Apply a waterproofing spray to shield your shoes from rain and snow. This is especially important for suede and fabric materials.

                    <p>
                        Avoid wearing the same pair of shoes every day. Giving them time to air out will prolong their lifespan and maintain their shape.

                        Store your shoes in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Use shoe trees or stuff them with newspaper to retain their shape.
